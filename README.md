# COSI123A-HW4-Build-Regression-Model
There are 10 data sets (5 in folder a and 5 in fold b), each data set has a training subset (for example, ‘Train_1a.csv’) and a test subset (for example, ‘Train_1a.csv’). Build a regression model using the training subset and apply the model to the test subset to obtain the predictions.
